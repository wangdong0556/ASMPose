# ASMPose

ASMPose is a human pose estimation implementation based on the [vMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba) framework. This project explores the use of structured state-space models for efficient keypoint detection.

## 📄 Project Description

This repository currently contains a single demo file that demonstrates how to perform human pose estimation using vMamba. The method leverages the long-sequence modeling capability of vMamba to capture both local and global dependencies between keypoints.

## 🚀 Quick Start

   Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/asmpose.git
   cd asmpose
# ASMPose can be implemented based on the architectural settings of both **vMamba(https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba)** and **TransPose(https://github.com/yangsenius/TransPose)**, combining the advantages of state-space modeling and spatial feature aggregation for accurate pose estimation.
