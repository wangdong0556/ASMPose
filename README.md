# ASMPose

ASMPose is a human pose estimation implementation based on the Mamba framework. This project explores the use of structured state-space models for efficient keypoint detection.

## 📄 Project Description

This repository currently contains a single demo file that demonstrates how to perform human pose estimation using Mamba. The method leverages the long-sequence modeling capability of Mamba to capture both local and global dependencies between keypoints.
